# MX-addons
Some of the extensions I made for Maxthon (MX3/MX5)

You need [MxPacker](https://forum.maxthon.com/index.php?/topic/15294-sdk-maxthon-extension-development-guide-package-tool-20150521/) to make **.mxaddon** file:
* Just drag the extension directory onto the MxPacker.exe icon (no need to run it) to make a package.
* Or double click the MxPacker icon to run it, and pack or unpack a package using the GUI.

Double click to install **.mxaddon** to the browser or just copy it to the addons directory if you use a portable version.
